🚀 CI/CD with Jenkins
This project uses Jenkins to implement a full CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline. Jenkins automates building, testing, and deploying applications, improving development speed and consistency.

🔁 What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration (CI):

Automatically builds and tests code every time a developer pushes to the repository.

Helps catch bugs early and ensures code quality.

Continuous Deployment (CD):

Automatically deploys the application to a server (or container, or Kubernetes cluster) after a successful build.

Reduces manual work and enables fast releases.

⚙️ Jenkins Pipeline Overview
This project uses a Declarative Pipeline defined in a Jenkinsfile.

Typical pipeline stages:

groovy

Edit
pipeline {
    agent any

    tools {
        jdk 'jdk17'
        maven 'maven3'
    }

    environment {
        SONARQUBE_SCANNER = 'sonar-scanner'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }

        stage('Code Quality Check') {
            steps {
                withSonarQubeEnv('sonar-scanner') {
                    sh 'mvn sonar:sonar'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Docker Build & Push') {
            steps {
                withDockerRegistry(credentialsId: 'your-dockerhub-creds-id', toolName: 'docker-latest') {
                    sh 'docker build -t draja27/your-image-name .'
                    sh 'docker push draja27/your-image-name'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
            steps {
                kubeconfig(
                    credentialsId: 'kube-config',
                    serverUrl: 'https://your-k8s-api-endpoint'
                ) {
                    sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
💡 You can customize stages like Test, Security Scan (Trivy), or Notify (Slack/Email) based on your stack.
